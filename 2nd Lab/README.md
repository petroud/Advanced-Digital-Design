The design for the 2nd lab of the course was made using bottom-up approach.<br>

The main goal of the exercise was to design a carry look ahead adder in VHDL
adding binary numbers up to 4 bits length.<br>

The overall circuit consists of 3 submodules:
* Propagate & Generate carry unit
* Carry look ahead unit
* Sum unit

<br>
The adder architecture is implemented by the <strong>Carry Look Ahead Adder</strong> unit that bonds all the entities together. 

#### The code was developed in cooperation with @gfrangias
