The design for the 3rd lab implements a binary counter controlled by a 3bit input signal. This, sets at
every cycle the counting step.
The counter also has a synchronous reset signal. 

Since the counter has increasing and decreasing counting steps, an overflow and underflow control for the output is also implemented
#### The code was developed in cooperation with @gfrangias
